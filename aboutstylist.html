            <p >Ex-Shopaholic. With a decades’ history of overspending her clothing budget and overloading her closet space, yet knowing that “I-have-nothing-to-wear” conundrum too well.</p>
                <p>Yes, that was me. My name is Tatiana Sullivan. I used to have one huge and overwhelming wardrobe. It was fun to buy new stuff every week, but less fun to realize that the clothes didn’t always work out perfectly. The toughest part was that guilt of seeing never worn pieces on hangers, with the tags still on, but too late to be returned to the store. Thinking “maybe, I’ll find the way to wear it?..” The truth is – no. I didn’t know how. Or where. Or even why I bought them. It was my stress relief, proving to myself I deserved to be treated with a new expensive fashion piece. Compulsive, pure emotional, and mindless shopping.</p>      ⠀
                <p>One day, after I collected yet another huge bag of clothing for giveaway, I decided it couldn’t continue like that. I got tired of being unhappy with my style. The idea of spending money on something, that perhaps just made it to the landfill was disgusting. I could’ve just thrown cash in the trash – but even this would’ve been better, saving our planet some fashion footprints.</p>
                <p>That’s when I first reached out for help from professional fashion stylist. She helped me build a decent wearable wardrobe, however I still wanted to continue improving it. I took my first fashion styling class, learned color theory basics and outfit building techniques. And I fell in love. I realized that this knowledge and consistent approach to building a wardrobe is key to everyday dressing – joyfully and worry-free. I’ve spent last two years continuously studying and obtained Image Consultant and Personal Shopper certification. I started providing individual consultations and help with shopping.</p>
                <p>Now I’m starting <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sullivanstylist/" target="_blank">this blog</a> to share my knowledge and inspiration with everyone who wants to build their wardrobe thoughtfully. A wardrobe where pieces come together in outfits effortlessly, for any occasion, and fitting their owner’s lifestyle and personality. And where there will never again be unworn pieces in the closet with the tags still on.</p>
